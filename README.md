# Prediction-on-Fashion-MNIST-Dataset

1. Load the Fashion MNIST Dataset into dataloaders
2. Apply Logistic regression to predict the image.
3. Plot the evaluation metrics graphs.
4. Apply Logistic Regression with L2 Regularisation
5. Plot confusion matrix
6. Predict using Convolutional Neural Network with 2 convolutional layers and 5 fully connected layers.
7. Repeat the prediction using Convolutional Neural Network with 5 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers.
8. Implement unsupervised learning methods like PCA, K-Means, Autoencoder on the data.
